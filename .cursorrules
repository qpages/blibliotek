# React & JSX Rules

- Do not import React from 'react' (React 17+ JSX transform)
- Use functional components with hooks, avoid class components
- Component files should have .jsx extension

# Naming Conventions

- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `VideoPlayer.jsx`)
- Hooks: camelCase with 'use' prefix (e.g., `useVideoControls`)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., `formatDate.js`)
- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- Files: Match the main export name

# Tailwind CSS

- Use Tailwind utility classes, avoid custom CSS when possible
- Use Prettier with prettier-plugin-tailwindcss for automatic class sorting
- Prefer Tailwind's responsive prefixes (sm:, md:, lg:) over custom breakpoints
- Use classnames library for conditional classes

# Import Order

1. External dependencies (React, libraries)
2. Internal absolute imports
3. Relative imports (./components, ./utils)
4. Styles (./index.css)
5. Types/interfaces (if using TypeScript)

# Code Quality

- Prefer const over let, avoid var
- Use arrow functions for components and callbacks
- Destructure props in function parameters
- Use && and nullish coalescing (??)
- Keep JSX clean: extract complex expressions into variables

# Performance

- Use React.memo() for expensive components
- Memoize callbacks with useCallback when passed as props
- Memoize computed values with useMemo
- Lazy load routes and heavy components with React.lazy()
- Avoid inline object/array literals in JSX when possible

# State Management

- Prefer local state (useState) when possible
- Lift state only when necessary
- Consider useReducer for complex state logic
- Keep state as close to where it's used as possible

# Event Handlers

- Prefix with 'handle' (e.g., handleClick, handleSubmit)
- Define handlers before JSX return
- Use arrow functions to avoid binding issues

# Props

- Destructure props for clarity
- Use default parameters for optional props
- Prefer specific prop names over generic ones (e.g., `onVideoEnd` vs `onEnd`)

# Hooks Rules

- Call hooks at the top level (not in conditions/loops)
- Custom hooks must start with 'use'
- Include all dependencies in useEffect/useCallback/useMemo arrays
- Clean up effects that need it (return cleanup function)

# Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements
- Include alt text for images
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Use ARIA labels when needed

# Vite Specific

- Use Vite's fast refresh for development
- Leverage Vite's asset handling for images/videos
- Use import.meta.env for environment variables
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
