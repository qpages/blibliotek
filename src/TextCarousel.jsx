// Text Carousel Effect (Prompt Description)
// https://www.megaeth.com/

/*

“Create a rotating 3D text-carousel effect where a vertical column of words scrolls toward the viewer. The central word is large, bold, and in sharp black, appearing closest to the camera. Surrounding words above and below gradually fade in size, opacity, and contrast as they curve away on a cylindrical path, giving a sense of depth and rotation. The background is a soft, minimal beige. Small left- and right-arrow icons flank the carousel, and a small square thumbnail on the side changes with each central word. The overall aesthetic is clean, modern, and typographic-focused with smooth scrolling motion.”
